# shelve9 -- Booksharing for Professional Development

Books are the one of the foundations of all real understanding, they are what
civilization and progress is built upon. Let's foster a culture of reading,
discussing and sharing books in our organisations.

## The Vision

Towards the goal of fostering reading in a professional context, these ideas are
especially relevant:

### Recommend Good Books

When you find a truly good book, you should recommend it to your colleagues. You
should put in on the common shelve and proudly put your name on it, so others
can borrow it. But also to clearly state that you think it is a great book and
others should read it. That you welcome to talk about it, whether people agree
with your view or even more so if they do not.

### Make them come alive

Books are much more than the text inside. Their weight and haptics make them
a much more serious experience. The typesetting and layout support the message,
The fact that they have physical reality makes them immediately feel more
valuable. It communicates that you need to make time and space, and invest focus 
on the contents. 

No "virtual" book shelve can replace that, but it needs to at least try to
convey some of the gravity and importance of a real library.

### Serendipity

Most real good reads are chance finds. If you deliberately went looking for a
book, you probably would not benefit as much from it. One reason is that the
core idea of the book must have already affected you, otherwise you would not
seek it out. 

But there is also a very dangerous feedback loop if you only read what you 
are actively looking for, you never get challenged or shaken out of your comfort
zone of ideas.

So browsing for books must be less targeted and focused, and contain an element
of chance findings.

### Suggest Discussions

When we read books, we must discuss them with others that have also read them.
It would be easy, and tempting, to "support" this within a virtual bookshelve.
But any form of tele-communication is lacking the bandwidth, dynamic range of
meaning and fidelity that actual face to face talking can provide.

As a consequence, shelve9 will only support the initial finding of others that
have read the book, and a tiny bit of what they may have to say as a starting 
point for real discussions.

## A Deconstructivist View

The above paints a relatively clear picture of what shelve9 could look like:
some sort of very graphical and faithful representation of the physical books,
and a way to interact with them that mimics browsing through an actual small
library, and leafing through the books within.

But is that not a disgustingly reactionary attempt to bring back the "good old
library"? Not only a hopeless one, but also a misguided one. Like the
"calculator apps" that you can get for some computers, with rendered tiny
plastic buttons and a 7-segmetn LCD display, it would with great effort produce
something inferior on a much more capable foundation. A real computer,
connected to all other computers and thereby people in the world, showing you
pictures of dead-tree, linear books? 

So if you have a crazy, post-modern idea of how to do away with the books or the
representation of them in shelve9, yet still preserve the increase in
understanding and discussion, then please let me know!

## Using shelve9

shelve9 is in no way ready to be used for anything, but see the next section on
how to get it closer to that point.
